Hello there, my name is Bob.

Joe  0:06  
Hey Bob, how are you doing?

Bob  0:10  
I am doing well, thank you. Let's get started with our design project.

Joe  0:19  
All right, let's do it. Where shall we start?

Bob  0:26  
Let's start by looking at this flange over here, and make sure it is strong enough to support this weight.

Joe  0:39  
Yes, good idea. Let's do that.

Bob  0:43  
Can you start up SolidWorks. Let's look at the model.

Joe  0:51  
Sure thing, Bob. Let me get my computer and start up SolidWorks and look at the flange.

Bob  1:04  
Looks like it is good enough to support the weight.

Joe  1:11  
Now we should investigate how much weight the whole structure can hold.

Bob  1:23  
Yes, great idea. Can you also can you open the file that has the whole assembly.

Joe  1:37  
Yes. Coming right up.
